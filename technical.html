<strong>Jeppesen Aqequate Visibility Reference</strong><br><br>
Airlines may specify other than standard takeoff minimums. The minimums and visual reference requirements will be contained in paragraphs C056 and C078 of their Ops Specs. For any operation in which the visbility is less than 1/2SM, Ops Specs paragraph C078 states the "visual reference" requirements. Visual references include various lighting or centerline markings.

<div class="box">
	<strong>C078. IFR Lower Than Standard Takeoff Minimums. All Airports</strong><br><br>
	Runway visual range (RVR) reports, when available for a particual runway, shall be used for all takeoff operations on that runway. All takeoff operations, based on RVR, must use the RVR reports from the locations along the runway specified in this paragraph. When takeoff minimums are equal to or less than the applicable standard takeoff minimum, the certifcate holder is authorized to use the loower than standard takeoff minimums described below:<br><br>

	When no visual aids are available, visility or RVV (Runway Visibility Value) 1/4 statute mile may still be used, provided other runway markings or runway lighting provide pilots with adequate visual reference to continuously identiy the take off surface and maintain directional control throughout the takeoff run.<br><br>

	(Almost any runway markings will work. CL lights, CL marking, runway edge lights, etc. A snow-covered runway without visbile lighting wouldn't qualify. When you go below the 1/4sm or RVR1600' level you need specific lighting and/or markings which are listed with the takeoff minimums.)<br><br>

	(1) Visibility or runway visual value (RVV) 1/2 sm or touchdown zone RVR1600, provided at least one of the folllowing visual aids is available. The touchdown zone RVR report, if available, is controlling. The mid RVR reprot may be substituted for the touchdown zone RVR report if the touchdown zone RVR is not avilable.<br>
	(a) Operative high intensity runway lights (HIRL).<br>
	(b) Operative runway centerline lights (CL).<br>
	(c) Serviceable runway centerline markings (RCLM).<br><br>

<strong>Low-Level Clouds (Surface to 6,500 ft AGL)</strong><br><br>
Clouds found around this altitude are mostly made of water droplets, sometimes supercooled, these clouds can cause icingâ€”bad news for pilots. Low clouds reduce visibility, create low ceilings, and shift rapidly, often grounding VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flights.<br><br>
<strong>Example of these clouds:</strong><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Stratus</li>
		<li>Stratocumulus</li>
		<li>Nimbostratus</li>
	</ul>
<strong>Impact</strong><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Poor visibility</li>
		<li>Potential icing</li>
		<li>Low ceilings</li>

		<li>
			<p><strong>What weather conditions can be expected for a flight arriving at 13z?</strong></p>
			<p class="answer hidden">Variable direction winds up to 3 knots with 2SM visibility, mist, and a ceiling of 300'. Temporary conditions of 1/SM, fog and an overcast ceiling of 200' is possible</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>For an arrival to DFW at 13z, what is/are the forecast visibilities?</strong></p>
			<p class="answer hidden">4SM with a temporary condition of 1sm. Note how the actual doesn't match the forecast. Actual is 1/2SM and forecast shows the lowest as 1SM.</p>
